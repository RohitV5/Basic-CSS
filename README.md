# Basic-CSS

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language readable and beautiful.

    Good : Use text size between 15 and 25 pixels for content based on content.

    For Headlines and Titles use 60px and 32px.
    Descrease font weight if using very big fonts.

    Line spacing makes text easier to read, but too much is also bas . use accordingly.

    78 chars per line is optimum to read. Too much or too less is bad.
